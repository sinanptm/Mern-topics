Authentication vs Authorization{
    Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It's about confirming that someone is who they claim to be.
    Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It's about granting or denying permissions to resources or actions.
    Authorization can only occur after authentication.

Local storage vs Session storage{
    Local storage and session storage are both part of the Web Storage API
    Local Storage{
        localStorage will be available for any tab or window in the browser, and will exist until it is deleted by the user or the program.
         Unlike a cookie, you cannot setup expiration. localStorage has a much larger storage limit as well.
    }
    Session Storage{
        sessionStorage is only for that browser tab's session. If you close the tab, the session will be lost and the data will be lost too,
         it's similar to a session variable on any backend language.
    }
}
Session and cookies{
    those are mechanisms to store information about user's interactions with a web application;
    Cookies: Small data storage on the client side, used for persisting information across browser sessions. Useful for non-sensitive data and settings.
    Sessions: Server-side storage with a session ID on the client side. Better suited for sensitive data and user-specific information that should not be exposed to the client.
}
BOM (Browser Object Model):{
    The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a collection of objects provided by the browser to interact with the web page and its environment. 
     The BOM allows you to control the browser window, navigate to different URLs, retrieve information about the browser, etc.

Regex{
    const pattern = /hello/;
    const str = "hello world";
    console.log(pattern.test(str)); // true
    const replacedStr = str.replace(pattern, "hi");
    const caseInsensitivePattern = /hello/i;
}
Load balancing{
    load balancing is technique used to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
    Hardware Load Balancers: Physical devices that distribute traffic.
    Software Load Balancers: Software solutions that run on standard servers.

CSRF {
    CSRF is an attack where a malicious site tricks a user's browser
    into making unintended requests to another site where the user is authenticated
}
XSS{
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites.
}
CORS{
    CORS allows requests from one origin to another
    Browser sends a preflight OPTIONS request to check permissions
    server return with a method header, eg:
    
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
    Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
}
JWT {
    Header: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token and the algorithm used for signing.
    Payload: Contains the claims, which are the actual statements about the entity and additional data.
    Signature: Ensures that the token hasn't been altered. It's created by taking the encoded header and payload, a secret key, and the algorithm specified in the header.
    claims: claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. They are contained in the payload (or body) of the JWT and help to convey information between parties.
}
HTTP Status codes{
    301 Moved Permanently: Permanent URL change, SEO-friendly.
    302 Found: Temporary URL change, not for permanent redirection.
    201 Created: Successful resource creation.
    401 Unauthorized: Authentication required.
    400 Bad Request: Malformed request.
    403 Forbidden: Access denied despite authentication.
}
content types{
    multipart/form-data: form data
    text/html: HTML documents
    text/plain: Plain text
    application/json: JSON data
    application/xml: XML data
    text/css: CSS stylesheets
    application/javascript: JavaScript files
    image/jpeg: JPEG images

default port of HTTPS and HTTP{
    HTTP: 80
    HTTPS: 443
}
reverse proxy{
    A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers, intercepting requests from clients and forwarding them to the appropriate backend server. It acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from those servers.

pm2{
    PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, reload them without downtime, and facilitate common system administration tasks.
}
SSH{
    Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for securely accessing and managing network devices and servers over an unsecured network. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network using public-key cryptography.
}
subdomain{
    A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. Subdomains are used to organize and navigate to different sections of a website.
    For example, in the domain blog.example.com, blog is the subdomain of example.com
}
DNS{
    The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phone book of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names,
     like nyTimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
      DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

basic linux command{
    Sudo : Grants specific users administrative privileges for executing commands.
    File and directory operations: ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, rm, cp, mv.
    File viewing and editing: cat, less, nano, vim.
    System information: uname -a, top, df -h, free -h.
    Networking: ifconfig, ping, curl, wget.
    Permissions and ownership: chmod, chown.
}
idempotency{
     An API call or operation is idempotent if it has the same result no matter how many times it's applied. That is, an idempotent operation provides protection against accidental duplicate calls causing unintended consequences.
